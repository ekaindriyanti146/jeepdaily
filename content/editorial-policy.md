## 1. Commitment to Technical Accuracy
Trust is the currency of automotive journalism. At **dother.biz.id**, we employ a rigorous fact-checking process, specifically regarding mechanical specifications and safety data.

*   **Technical Verification:** Every torque spec, towing capacity, and part compatibility listed in our guides is cross-referenced against **OEM Factory Service Manuals (FSM)** and official bulletins from Stellantis/FCA US LLC.
*   **Safety First:** We prioritize safety in our "How-To" guides. All installation tutorials include necessary safety warnings (e.g., proper use of jack stands, torque wrench calibration).
*   **Corrections:** If a factual error occurs—whether it be a model year discrepancy or a technical figure—we are committed to correcting it promptly. A standardized "Correction Note" will be appended to the bottom of the article detailing the change and the date it was made.

## 2. Sourcing & Attribution
We believe in giving credit where it is due and relying on primary sources.

*   **Official Sources:** We prioritize data from **Stellantis Media**, **NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)**, and reputable tier-1 automotive suppliers (e.g., Dana, Fox, Bosch).
*   **Industry News:** We distinguish clearly between "Official Confirmations," "Reports from Credible Outlets," and "Industry Speculation/Rumors." We do not publish unsubstantiated clickbait regarding future vehicle releases.

## 3. Product Reviews & Ethics
Our reviews of Jeep vehicles and aftermarket parts are conducted with objectivity.

*   **Independence:** Unless explicitly stated as "Sponsored Content," all reviews are independent.
*   **Press Vehicles & Parts:** Occasionally, manufacturers may provide vehicles or parts for testing purposes. This is standard industry practice. However, providing a product **never** guarantees a positive review. We retain full editorial control over the verdict.
*   **No "Pay-to-Play":** We do not accept payment in exchange for positive coverage or higher ratings in our "Best of" lists.

## 4. Use of Technology & AI
**dother.biz.id** utilizes advanced technology to assist in data organization and trend monitoring. However, **human oversight is mandatory**.

*   **The Human Element:** AI cannot drive a car, install a lift kit, or feel the articulation on a rocky trail. Therefore, all **driving impressions, installation experiences, and opinions are 100% human-generated**.
*   **AI as an Assistant:** AI tools may be used for structuring historical data tables or grammar checking, but final editorial approval is conducted by our human editors to ensure nuance, context, and emotional intelligence.

## 5. Conflict of Interest
Our writers and analysts are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. **dother.biz.id** maintains strict independence from any specific dealership, car club, or insurance agency that could compromise our objectivity.
