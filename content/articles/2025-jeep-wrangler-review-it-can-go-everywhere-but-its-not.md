The 2025 Jeep Wrangler comes with a range of engine options, including a 3.6L V6, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, and a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6.

The Wrangler also features a robust suspension system, with a five-link coil suspension in the front and a five-link coil suspension with a track bar in the rear.

The vehicle's off-road capabilities are further enhanced by its high ground clearance, approach and departure angles, and water fording capability.

The Wrangler's transmission options include a six-speed manual and an eight-speed automatic.

The following table summarizes the key technical specifications of the 2025 Jeep Wrangler:

| Engine | Horsepower | Torque | Transmission | Drive Type |

## Section 3: Real World Performance

The 2025 Jeep Wrangler is a beast on the trail, with its off-road capabilities unmatched by few other vehicles in its class.

The Wrangler's high ground clearance, approach and departure angles, and water fording capability make it capable of tackling even the most challenging terrain.

On the road, the Wrangler's performance is decent, with the 3.6L V6 engine providing adequate power for merging and passing.

However, the Wrangler's on-road handling can be improved, with a stiff ride and noticeable body roll in corners.
