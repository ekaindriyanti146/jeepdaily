### Barcelona Taught Harsh Lesson in Atlético's Copa del Rey Rout

**By Ben Foster** — *Data Journalist* — February 13, 2026

In the high-stakes world of Spanish football, few results sting quite like a heavy defeat in a cup semifinal. On Thursday, February 12, 2026, Barcelona endured one of their most chastening nights under Hansi Flick, falling 4-0 to Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinal at the Riyadh Air Metropolitano.

The scoreline tells only part of the story. All four goals arrived before halftime, turning a potentially tight tie into a near-insurmountable deficit. It began calamitously in the 6th minute when Eric García's back pass slipped under goalkeeper Joan García's foot for an own goal. From there, Atlético pounced.

Antoine Griezmann doubled the lead in the 14th minute with clinical precision, Ademola Lookman (recently arrived in January) added a third around the half-hour mark after a swift combination with Julián Álvarez, and Álvarez himself sealed the rout in first-half stoppage time, finally breaking his 11-game scoring drought.

Flick pulled no punches afterward. "We didn't play very good in the first half as a team," he said. "We had too much distance between everyone. We didn't press how we wanted. In the first 45 minutes or more, we got a lesson." He added that Atlético displayed more "will" and "hunger," qualities his side failed to match from the opening whistle.

Yet Flick remained defiant, framing the loss as a timely wake-up call. "Sometimes it's good in the right moment. Maybe today was the right moment," he reflected, while expressing pride in the team's season-long adaptation despite persistent injuries. Looking ahead, he outlined a clear target: "We have the second leg. We will fight for that. If we are able to win each half 2-0, this is our goal. We need our fans in Camp Nou and we will see what happens."

The second half offered glimpses of recovery—Barcelona pushed forward, created chances, and thought they had pulled one back via Pau Cubarsí in the 51st minute, only for VAR to disallow it after a lengthy review. A late red card for Joan García compounded the misery, leaving Barça down to 10 men.

Tactically, this exposed cracks in Flick's high-pressing system. When the press is ineffective and lines stretch, elite counter-attacking teams like Simeone's thrive. Atlético exploited transitions ruthlessly, with Griezmann pulling strings, Lookman providing fresh dynamism, and Álvarez rediscovering sharpness.

For Atlético, this was more than three points—it's a statement of intent. Simeone's men have blended resilience with attacking flair this season, and this dominant display edges them toward a first Copa final since 2013. Griezmann's goal continued his perfect Copa scoring record this campaign, underlining his enduring class.

Barcelona's title defense now hangs in the balance. As holders, the Blaugrana boast pedigree and home advantage in the return leg on March 3, but history shows 4-0 deficits in two-legged ties are rarely overturned. Flick must recalibrate intensity levels and ensure sharper starts, particularly with La Liga clashes looming (including a trip to Girona).

This result doesn't define Barcelona's season—Flick's side has shown resilience amid adversity—but it demands reflection. Atlético taught a brutal lesson in hunger, execution, and ruthlessness. The question now: can Barça heed it in time?
