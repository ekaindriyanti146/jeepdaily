This iconic jeep, born out of necessity during World War II, has become a symbol of American ingenuity and a timeless classic among car enthusiasts.

## Introduction to the Willys MB
The Willys MB, with its robust design and versatile capabilities, was the brainchild of the U.S. Army's quest for a lightweight, all-terrain vehicle that could withstand the harsh conditions of war.

The 'MB' designation was specifically for vehicles manufactured by Willys.

With a 60 horsepower engine and a three-speed manual transmission, this jeep was capable of tackling a variety of terrains, from the deserts of North Africa to the jungles of the Pacific.
