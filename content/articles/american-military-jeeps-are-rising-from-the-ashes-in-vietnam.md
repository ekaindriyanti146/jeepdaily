From the dense jungles of Vietnam to the arid deserts of the Middle East, these vehicles have proven their mettle time and time again. But what happens when these jeeps are no longer needed for military service? In Vietnam, a new trend is emerging - the restoration and repurposing of American military jeeps for civilian use. This phenomenon is not only a testament to the durability of these vehicles but also a reflection of their enduring appeal.
