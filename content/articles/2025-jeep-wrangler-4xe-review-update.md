The Jeep Wrangler is an iconic off-road vehicle that has been a staple of the automotive world for decades.

In this article, we will take a closer look at the 2025 Jeep Wrangler 4xe and explore its history, technical details, real-world performance, and how it compares to other models in the market.

## History/Context

The Jeep Wrangler has a rich history that dates back to the 1940s.

The first Wrangler was introduced in 1986 and was designed to be a direct replacement for the CJ-7.

Over the years, the Wrangler has undergone several updates and redesigns, with the most significant changes coming in 2018 with the introduction of the JL generation.

The 4xe model is a plug-in hybrid version of the Wrangler, which combines a traditional gasoline engine with an electric motor.

This allows the vehicle to run on electric power alone for up to 25 miles, making it an attractive option for those who want to reduce their carbon footprint.

The 2025 Jeep Wrangler 4xe is built on the same platform as the standard Wrangler, but with several key differences. The most notable difference is the addition of a 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which is located under the rear seats. This battery pack is charged via a 7.2-kilowatt charger, which can charge the battery to 100% in just over 2 hours.

## Technical Details/Engine/Suspension

The 2025 Jeep Wrangler 4xe is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, which produces 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an electric motor, which adds an additional 44 horsepower and 39 lb-ft of torque. The total system output is 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, making the 4xe one of the most powerful Wranglers on the market.

The 4xe also features a unique suspension system, which is designed to provide a smooth ride on both on-road and off-road surfaces. The vehicle features a five-link suspension system in the front and rear, with coil springs and stabilizer bars. This suspension system is designed to provide excellent articulation and stability, making it perfect for rock crawling and other off-road activities.
