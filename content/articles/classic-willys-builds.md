When on the trail, there's nothing quite like the sight of a vintage Willys Jeep navigating through the rough terrain with ease. These classic builds have been the foundation of modern Jeeps, and their influence can still be seen today. 
## History of Classic Willys Builds
### Early Years
The Willys MB, also known as the Jeep, was first introduced in 1941 as a military vehicle. Its rugged design and versatility made it an instant hit, and it quickly became a staple of the US military. After the war, the Willys MB was adapted for civilian use, and its popularity soared.
### Post-War Era
In the post-war era, Willys continued to innovate and improve their designs. The introduction of the Willys CJ-2 in 1945 marked a new era for the company, and the CJ-3 followed soon after. These models were designed for agricultural and industrial use, but they also found a niche in the growing off-road enthusiast community.
