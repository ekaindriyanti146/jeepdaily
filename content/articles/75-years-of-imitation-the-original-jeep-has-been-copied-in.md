# Introduction to the Original Jeep

The original Jeep, first introduced during World War II, has become an iconic symbol of off-road capability and durability. Its unique design, which combines a rugged four-wheel-drive system with a simple, utilitarian body, has been imitated by countless other manufacturers around the world. For 75 years, the Jeep has been the gold standard of off-road vehicles, and its influence can still be seen in many modern vehicles today.

## History and Context of the Jeep

The Jeep was first developed in the early 1940s, as the United States military sought a lightweight, four-wheel-drive vehicle that could navigate the rough terrain of the battlefield.

The first Jeeps were built by Willys-Overland, and they quickly became popular with soldiers due to their reliability, maneuverability, and off-road capability.

The Jeep's suspension consisted of a live front axle and a live rear axle, with leaf springs and shock absorbers providing a relatively smooth ride. The vehicle's simple design and rugged construction made it well-suited to off-road use, and it quickly became popular with outdoor enthusiasts and farmers.
