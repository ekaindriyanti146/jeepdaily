## Hook

The automotive world is constantly evolving, with manufacturers racing to stay ahead of the curve in terms of technology and innovation.

One of the most significant trends in recent years has been the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles, as companies seek to reduce their environmental impact and comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations.

However, not all experiments in this space have been successful, as evidenced by the recent announcement that the Jeep Gladiator 4xe plug-in hybrid is officially dead.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the history and context behind this decision, as well as the technical details and real-world performance of the Gladiator 4xe.

## Section 1: History/Context

The Jeep Gladiator 4xe was first introduced in 2020, as part of a broader effort by Jeep to electrify its lineup and appeal to a new generation of environmentally conscious consumers.

The Gladiator 4xe was based on the standard Gladiator pickup truck, but featured a plug-in hybrid powertrain that combined a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with an electric motor and a 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack.

This setup allowed the Gladiator 4xe to achieve an estimated 25 miles of electric-only range, making it an attractive option for those who wanted to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing the capability and versatility that Jeep is known for.

Despite its promising specs, however, the Gladiator 4xe failed to gain significant traction in the market, due in part to its high price point and limited availability.

## Section 2: Technical Details/Engine/Suspension

From a technical standpoint, the Jeep Gladiator 4xe was an impressive achievement, featuring a complex powertrain that integrated a gasoline engine, electric motor, and battery pack.

The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine produced 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor added an additional 90 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque.

The battery pack, which was mounted beneath the rear seats, had a capacity of 17 kilowatt-hours and could be charged in approximately 2 hours using a Level 2 charger.

In terms of suspension, the Gladiator 4xe featured a similar setup to the standard Gladiator, with a five-link coil suspension in the front and a five-link leaf spring suspension in the rear.

This combination provided a smooth ride and excellent off-road capability, making the Gladiator 4xe a compelling option for those who wanted to venture off the beaten path.

| **Specification** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | 2.0L Turbocharged I4 |
| Electric Motor | 90 HP, 130 lb-ft |
| Battery Pack | 17 kWh |
| Electric-Only Range | 25 miles |
| Total System Output | 360 HP, 425 lb-ft |
| Suspension | Five-Link Coil (Front), Five-Link Leaf Spring (Rear) |
| Ground Clearance | 11.1 inches |
| Approach/Departure Angles | 43.6/26 degrees |

## Section 3: Real World Performance

In terms of real-world performance, the Jeep Gladiator 4xe was a mixed bag.

On the one hand, its electric powertrain provided instant torque and silent operation, making it an excellent choice for low-speed maneuvering and off-road crawling.

The Gladiator 4xe was also capable of achieving an estimated 50 mpg-e in hybrid mode, making it a relatively fuel-efficient option for those who spent a lot of time in stop-and-go traffic.

On the other hand, the Gladiator 4xe was not without its flaws, including a high price point and limited electric-only range.

Additionally, the vehicle's complex powertrain and battery pack added significant weight and complexity, which could make it more difficult to repair and maintain.

## Section 4: Comparison/Verdict

So where does the Jeep Gladiator 4xe fit into the broader landscape of electric and hybrid vehicles? In terms of its competitors, the Gladiator 4xe was unique in its combination of off-road capability and plug-in hybrid technology.

However, its high price point and limited availability made it a tough sell for many consumers, who may have been drawn to more affordable options like the Ford F-150 Hybrid or the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Hybrid.

Ultimately, the discontinuation of the Gladiator 4xe is a reminder that the automotive industry is constantly evolving, and that not every experiment will be successful.

As Jeep moves forward, it will be interesting to see how the company incorporates electric and hybrid technology into its future products.
