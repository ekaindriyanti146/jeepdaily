Arsenal's Premier League campaign in 2025/26 has been a masterclass in consistency so far. With just 12 games left, Mikel Arteta's side top the table on 57 points from 26 matches (17 wins, 6 draws, 3 losses), boasting a +32 goal difference and having conceded only 18 goals all season. They are four points ahead of Manchester City (53 points from 26 games) and further clear of challengers like Aston Villa. Yet, after a frustrating 1-1 draw at Brentford on February 12, the familiar whispers of doubt have returned: will Arsenal's end-of-season form haunt them again?

The Gunners' position is undeniably strong. They have lost just three times all season and hold the league's best defensive record. Key to this has been the partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes, though Saliba's recent absence through illness highlighted vulnerabilities—Arsenal's win rate drops sharply without him (from 68.6% to 42.1% since 2022/23). The Brentford stalemate, where Noni Madueke's header cancelled out an early lead, marked only the second time this season Arsenal failed to win after scoring first.

This draw came at a pivotal moment. Just days earlier, Arsenal appeared on the verge of a commanding lead. A 3-0 win over Sunderland had them nine points clear provisionally, but Manchester City's dramatic late comeback victory over Liverpool (thanks to Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty) followed by a 3-0 win against Fulham swung momentum. City, with their proven ability to produce title-winning runs, reduced the gap to four points after Brentford. A win at the Gtech Community Stadium would have restored a six-point cushion, potentially nine with a midweek victory over Wolves before City's next outing.

History weighs heavily here. Arsenal have finished second for three successive seasons under Arteta, twice behind City. In the past five campaigns, they have won 10 or more of their final 12 league games only once—and never accumulated more points in that run than the eventual champions. This pattern fuels the narrative of late collapses, emotional scars for supporters who remember leads squandered.

Arteta remains defiant. 'We are going to be willing and preparing to win every single match,' he said post-Brentford. 'The only thing we can do is focus on that and raise the levels.' Declan Rice echoed the calm: 'This is a rollercoaster of a season... We have to block out the outside noise. We have a really calm group.' Yet injuries compound concerns—Kai Havertz's muscle issue after a knee return, multiple lineup changes (winning just two of the last seven with four or more alterations)—and the psychological pressure of City's 'know-how' looms large.

Experts are divided. Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown urged resilience: 'Arsenal are four points clear. You get knocked down, you get up again. Let's see who the fighters are.' Peter Crouch, however, called this Arsenal's best chance yet, noting weakened rivals: 'Man City are not the Man City of old, Liverpool aren't... If they don't get over the line, there needs to be more questions answered.' Crouch is right—the bar is lower this year, with no dominant force like City's past vintages.

The run-in will test Arsenal's mettle. Next up is Wolves, then tough tests like Tottenham. City face Newcastle and others, but their experience in closing seasons is unmatched. Arsenal control their destiny, but must avoid the panic Arteta warns against.

This title race is far from over. Arsenal's defensive solidity and attacking threat give them every chance to finally lift the trophy. But if end-of-season frailties resurface, history suggests City will pounce. The next dozen games will define whether 2025/26 ends in glory or another heartbreaking second place. For now, the pressure is on the leaders to prove they have learned from the past.
