## The Birth of a Legend
The Jeep Wrangler's story began in the 1940s, with the introduction of the Willys MB, a military vehicle designed for World War II. The Willys MB's success led to the development of the CJ (Civilian Jeep) series, which was first introduced in 1945. The CJ series was designed for agricultural and industrial use, but it quickly gained popularity among off-road enthusiasts.
