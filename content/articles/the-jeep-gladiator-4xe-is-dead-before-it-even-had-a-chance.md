The automotive world was abuzz with the introduction of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe, a plug-in hybrid version of the popular Gladiator pickup truck. However, in a shocking turn of events, the Gladiator 4xe has been discontinued, leaving many to wonder what led to its demise. With its unique blend of off-road capability and eco-friendliness, the Gladiator 4xe seemed like a sure winner. But, as we'll explore in this article, the reality was far more complex.

The Jeep Gladiator 4xe was first introduced in 2020, as part of Jeep's efforts to expand its electrified lineup. The Gladiator 4xe was designed to offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered pickup trucks, while still maintaining the off-road capability that Jeep is known for. The 4xe was part of a larger trend in the automotive industry, as manufacturers began to shift their focus towards more sustainable and eco-friendly vehicles. However, despite its promising start, the Gladiator 4xe ultimately failed to gain traction in the market.

## Section 2: Technical Details/Engine/Suspension

The Jeep Gladiator 4xe was powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four cylinder engine, paired with an electric motor and a 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack. This powertrain produced a total of 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, making it one of the most powerful vehicles in its class. The 4xe also featured a unique regenerative braking system, which helped to recharge the battery pack and improve overall efficiency. The suspension system was also specially tuned to handle the added weight of the battery pack, while still maintaining the Gladiator's legendary off-road capability.

| **Specification** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four cylinder |
| Electric Motor | 90 kW |
| Battery Pack | 17-kilowatt-hour |
| Horsepower | 375 |
| Torque | 470 lb-ft |
| Regenerative Braking | Yes |
| Suspension | Specially tuned for off-road capability |

## Section 3: Real World Performance

In real-world testing, the Jeep Gladiator 4xe proved to be a capable and efficient vehicle. The electric motor provided instant torque and smooth acceleration, making it well-suited for off-road driving. The regenerative braking system also helped to improve overall efficiency, allowing the 4xe to achieve an estimated 50 mpg-e in combined driving. However, the added weight of the battery pack did affect the 4xe's overall handling and performance, making it feel slightly less agile than its gasoline-powered counterpart.

## Section 4: Comparison/Verdict

So, what led to the demise of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe? In comparison to other plug-in hybrid pickup trucks on the market, the 4xe was priced relatively high, with a starting MSRP of over $50,000. Additionally, the 4xe's limited electric-only range and lack of standard features, such as adaptive cruise control, made it less competitive in the market. Ultimately, the Gladiator 4xe was a unique and innovative vehicle, but it failed to gain traction in a crowded and competitive market.
