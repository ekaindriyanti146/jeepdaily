# Introduction

As the automotive industry continues to evolve, Stellantis, the parent company of 14 car brands, is considering axing some of its brands. In this article, we will play a game of armchair executive and decide the fate of each brand. With a diverse portfolio of brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram, Stellantis has a significant presence in the global automotive market.

## Section 1: History and Context

Stellantis was formed in 2021 through the merger of FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) and PSA Group (Peugeot Société Anonyme). The company's portfolio includes a wide range of brands, each with its own unique history and strengths. Jeep, for example, is one of the most iconic and recognizable brands in the world, with a rich history dating back to the 1940s. On the other hand, brands like Lancia and DS have struggled to gain traction in recent years.
