## Why the Rock-Trac System Changes Everything
The 2024 Jeep Gladiator boasts an impressive Rock-Trac system, providing unparalleled off-road capabilities. With a ground clearance of 11.1 inches and a maximum towing capacity of up to 7,650 pounds, this JT model is a force to be reckoned with. The Rock-Trac system, available on the Rubicon trim, features a two-speed transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, allowing for precise control in challenging terrain.
## Tackling Moab with 35-Inch Tires
Equipped with 35-inch tires, the 2024 Jeep Gladiator is well-suited for tackling demanding off-road trails like Moab. The JK and JL models have paved the way for the JT's success, with the Gladiator's longer wheelbase and wider track providing increased stability. The 3.6L V6 engine, producing 285 HP and 260 lb-ft of torque, provides ample power for both on- and off-road adventures.

## Willys MB Heritage Meets Modern Capability
