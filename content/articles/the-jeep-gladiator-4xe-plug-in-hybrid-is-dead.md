<h1>The Jeep Gladiator 4xe Plug-in Hybrid Is Officially Dead</h1>
## Introduction to the Jeep Gladiator 4xe
The Jeep Gladiator 4xe was a plug-in hybrid version of the popular Gladiator pickup truck. It was first introduced in 2020 and was designed to provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. However, despite its unique features and capabilities, the Gladiator 4xe has been discontinued.
### Key Features of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe
Some of the key features of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe include:
* Plug-in hybrid powertrain with a 2.0L turbocharged engine and an electric motor
* 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque
* 0-60 mph in 6.0 seconds
* Up to 25 miles of electric-only range
* Towing capacity of up to 7,650 pounds
## Reasons for Discontinuation
The reasons for the discontinuation of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe are not entirely clear, but it is likely due to a combination of factors, including low sales and high production costs. The Gladiator 4xe was a niche product, and it may not have appealed to a wide enough audience to justify continued production.
### Comparison to Other Hybrid Pickup Trucks
The Jeep Gladiator 4xe was one of the first plug-in hybrid pickup trucks on the market, but it was not without its competitors. Other hybrid pickup trucks, such as the Ford F-150 Hybrid and the Ram 1500 eTorque, have also been introduced in recent years. The following table compares some of the key features of these vehicles:
| Vehicle | Engine | Horsepower | Torque | Electric-Only Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jeep Gladiator 4xe | 2.0L turbocharged | 375 | 470 | 25 miles |
| Ford F-150 Hybrid | 3.0L V6 | 450 | 510 | N/A |
| Ram 1500 eTorque | 3.6L V6 | 305 | 269 | N/A |
## Conclusion
The discontinuation of the Jeep Gladiator 4xe marks the end of an era for the electrified pickup truck. While it was an innovative product, it may not have been the right fit for the market. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other manufacturers approach the development of hybrid and electric vehicles.
