## The Trail Rated Badge: A Symbol of Excellence
The Trail Rated badge is a prestigious honor bestowed upon Jeep vehicles that have demonstrated exceptional off-road capabilities. To earn this badge, a Jeep must undergo a series of rigorous tests, including traction, water fording, maneuverability, articulation, and ground clearance. These tests push the vehicle to its limits, ensuring that it can handle even the most challenging off-road terrain.

### 4x4 Systems: The Heart of Jeep's Off-Road Performance
Jeep's 4x4 systems are the backbone of its off-road prowess. The company offers a range of 4x4 systems, each designed to provide exceptional traction and control in various off-road conditions. The Rock-Trac 4x4 system, for example, features a two-speed transfer case and a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, making it ideal for rock crawling and other low-speed off-road activities.

#### Articulation: The Key to Off-Road Success
Articulation is a critical factor in off-road performance, as it allows the vehicle to maintain traction and control on uneven terrain. Jeep's suspension systems are designed to provide exceptional articulation, allowing the wheels to move independently and maintain contact with the ground. The Wrangler Rubicon, for example, features a suspension system that provides up to 10.8 inches of articulation, making it one of the most capable off-road vehicles on the market.

## Suspension Tech: The Unsung Hero of Off-Road Performance
Jeep's suspension systems are a crucial component of its off-road performance. The company offers a range of suspension systems, each designed to provide exceptional control and stability in various off-road conditions. The Wrangler's suspension system, for example, features a five-link design with coil springs and shock absorbers, providing a smooth ride on the highway and exceptional control on the trail.
