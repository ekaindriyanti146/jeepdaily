The title race in the Premier League is heating up, and Arsenal's latest stumble against Brentford has spotlighted a worrying trend for Mikel Arteta's side.

**Are Arsenal Feeling the Pressure Because of One Simple Reason?**

As a senior editor covering English football, I've watched Arsenal evolve into genuine title contenders under Arteta. Their blend of tactical discipline, youthful energy, and strategic signings has them sitting atop the table—but the cracks are showing at the worst possible moment.

The 1-1 draw at Brentford on February 12, 2026, was another unconvincing display. Noni Madueke headed Arsenal ahead in the 61st minute, but Keane Lewis-Potter equalized nine minutes later from a well-worked set-piece. Arsenal missed golden opportunities—Igor Thiago and Gabriel Martinelli squandered big chances—while defensive lapses, including errors from Gabriel and David Raya, invited Brentford's chaos.

This wasn't an isolated slip. Since the turn of the year, Arsenal have played four Premier League matches immediately after Manchester City in the gameweek schedule—and dropped points in every single one.

- After City's win over Wolves, Arsenal lost to Manchester United.
- Following City's loss in the Manchester derby, Arsenal failed to capitalize fully at Nottingham Forest.
- Post-City dropping points at Brighton, Arsenal drew with Liverpool.
- And now, after City's victory against Fulham, the Gunners were held by Brentford.

In contrast, when Arsenal play first in a round—such as their wins over Sunderland, Bournemouth, and Aston Villa—they appear far more composed, decisive, and ruthless.

The pattern is clear: playing in City's wake seems to bring out vulnerabilities. The lead that once stood at nine points has shrunk to four with just 12 games remaining. City, with their unparalleled experience in closing out titles under Pep Guardiola, can "smell blood" and keep the pressure relentless.

Why does this happen? Arteta has downplayed scheduling as a factor, insisting his team has won games after City before and that the Brentford issues stemmed from poor prevention of chaotic moments rather than nerves. But title races amplify everything. The psychological weight of knowing City have just won (or even dropped points) can subconsciously tighten muscles, invite overthinking, and lead to those uncharacteristic errors—wayward passes, fouls in dangerous areas, missed sitters.

Arsenal boast incredible squad depth, yet the intensity of competing on multiple fronts—Premier League, cups, perhaps Europe—adds fatigue. Brentford's physical, direct style exposed Arsenal's occasional struggle against low-block disruption, but the recurring post-City dip suggests a mental component. City's aura looms large; their ability to respond immediately after Arsenal's results keeps the chasers motivated.

This isn't about doubting Arsenal's quality—they've earned their position with more wins than City in some metrics and a strong defensive record. But closing out a first league title since 2004 requires mastering these pressure moments. The next fixtures will test this: Wolves away (a chance to strike first before City can respond), then tough London derbies against Tottenham and Chelsea, where similar questions about composure will arise.

If Arsenal can break this pattern—perhaps by treating every game in isolation, leaning on their leaders like Martin Ødegaard or William Saliba for calm—the title remains theirs to lose. But if the trend continues, City's experience could prove decisive in a razor-thin race.

The pressure is real, and it's not just from the table. It's from the calendar, the opponent in blue, and the weight of history. Arsenal must find a way to perform without the shadow of City's results dictating their mindset.

The title race is well and truly on. Arsenal's response in the coming weeks will define whether this pattern becomes a footnote or a fatal flaw.
