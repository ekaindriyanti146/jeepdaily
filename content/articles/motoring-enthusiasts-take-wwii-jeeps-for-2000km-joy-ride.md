## The Birth of a Legend
The Jeep's story began during World War II, when the US military needed a rugged and reliable vehicle that could navigate challenging terrain. The Willys MB, the first Jeep, was born in 1941 and quickly became an iconic symbol of American ingenuity and determination. With its lightweight design, four-wheel drive capability, and powerful engine, the Jeep proved to be an invaluable asset on the battlefield.

### The CJ and the Birth of Civilian Jeeps
After the war, the Jeep's popularity extended beyond the military, and the first civilian Jeep, the CJ-2, was introduced in 1945. The CJ series, which included the CJ-2, CJ-3, and CJ-5, was designed for farming, construction, and other applications where a rugged and versatile vehicle was needed. The CJ series paved the way for the modern Jeep Wrangler, which was introduced in 1986.
