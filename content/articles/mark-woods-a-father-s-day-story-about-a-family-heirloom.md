The engine is paired with a three-speed manual transmission and a two-speed transfer case, allowing for a maximum speed of 60 mph. The Jeep's suspension features a live front axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs and a live rear axle with quarter-elliptical leaf springs, providing a smooth ride and excellent off-road capability. Other notable features include a folding windshield, a removable top, and a rear-mounted spare tire.
